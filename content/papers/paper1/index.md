##### Abstract

This paper explores a YOLOv8-based approach for detecting objects in real-time video streams. By leveraging custom datasets, the model achieves higher accuracy and speed, reaching a mAP50 of 0.864 and mAP50-95 of 0.758. The study emphasizes the importance of custom training data for precision, making YOLOv8 a viable solution for real-world applications like robotics, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles.
