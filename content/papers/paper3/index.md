description: "This paper presents RealitySummary, a mixed reality assistant that uses OCR and large language models for on-demand text summarization and question-answering across physical and digital documents."
summary: "RealitySummary integrates OCR, markerless tracking, and GPT-based models to provide on-demand document augmentation. Iteratively developed over three studies—usability, in-the-wild, and diary—it demonstrates significant potential for real-world reading enhancement through MR-AI integration."

##### Abstract

RealitySummary is a mixed reality reading assistant that integrates OCR and GPT-based large language models for on-demand document summarization and question answering. Through three design iterations and corresponding user studies, the system showcases the potential of combining MR and AI for enhanced reading experiences across diverse real-world contexts.
